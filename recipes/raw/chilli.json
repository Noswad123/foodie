        "step": 1,
        "instructions": "Prepare the ingredients & make the sauce. Fill a large pot 3/4 of the way up with water; season with salt if desired. Cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Cut off and discard the root ends of the bok choy; roughly chop. Roughly chop the peanuts. Using a zester or the small side of a box grater, finely grate the lime to get 2 teaspoons of zest. Halve the lime crosswise; squeeze the juice into a bowl. To the bowl of lime juice, add the soy glaze, yuzu kosho, and orange marmalade; stir to thoroughly combine."

        "instructions": "Make the chili-lime peanuts. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped peanuts, lime zest, and as much of the chili crisp as you'd like, depending on how spicy you'd like the dish to be. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly toasted and fragrant. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe out the pan."

Cook, stirring frequently and breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened and the beef is browned and cooked through. Turn off the heat.
