      "instruction": "Prepare the ingredients & make the sauce. Fill a large pot 3/4 of the way up with water; season with salt if desired. Cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Cut off and discard the root ends of the bok choy; roughly chop. Roughly chop the peanuts. Using a zester or the small side of a box grater, finely grate the lime to get 2 teaspoons of zest. Halve the lime crosswise; squeeze the juice into a bowl. To the bowl of lime juice, add the soy glaze, yuzu kosho, and orange marmalade; stir to thoroughly combine."
